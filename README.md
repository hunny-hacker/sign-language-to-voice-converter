this was my smartBU hackathon project
in this project i have made indian sign language converter to voice
we can train our own model in this project
then it will simply from our camera detect sign and make a sentece then at last speak it
to run it first run collect_imgs.py file and it will start capturing images from our camera and store it
next run create_dataset.py file to create dataset of images received
next run train_classifier.py to train our model of machine learning
at last run inference_classifier.py to run our main file and start application
it was all made in 24 hours and we can work on it to make more impressive
